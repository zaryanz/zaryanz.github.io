Hi, I'm Aryan!
<br /><br />I'm a software engineer and an open source software enthusiast. I have a bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering from <strong>Indian Institute of Information Technology, Bhopal (IIIT-B)</strong> and am currently pursuing a master's in <strong>Information and Commmunication Systems</strong> from <strong>Technische Universit√§t Hamburg (TUHH)</strong>.
<br /><br />I have experience building cross-platform apps using React Native & iOS apps
using Swift and SwiftUI. I write backend code in Node.js and Java. I love experimenting with different tech and am always trying out something new.
<br /><br />This site is a space for me to showcase my projects and document my journey through blogs.
<br /><br />Feel free to <a href="mailto:aryanx404@gmail.com">reach out</a> to me if you have any questions!
